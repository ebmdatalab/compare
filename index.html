        <h3>Tracking Switched Outcomes in Clinical Trials</h3>

        <hr style="margin-bottom: 36px" />

         <p>Outcome switching in clinical trials is a serious problem (<a href="#problem">read why</a>). We are systematically checking every trial published in the top five medical journals, to see if they have misreported their findings.</p>

        <p>First, we compare each clinical trial report against its registry entry. Some trials report their outcomes perfectly. For the others, we count how many of the outcomes specified in the registry were never reported. And we count how many outcomes were silently added.</p>

        <p>Second, whenever we detect unreported or added outcomes, we write a letter to the journal pointing them out, so that readers are aware of the problems.  We are tracking which journals have published our letters after 4 weeks - and which haven't (see <a href='#approach'>our approach</a>).</p>

         <p>Here's what we've found so far. Our project is ongoing since October 2015, and these numbers are updated live.</p>

        <p><span id="letters_in_pipeline"><em>Loading...</em></span> letters are still awaiting a result, having been sent to journals less than 4 weeks ago.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Full results</h2>

          <p>The table below shows every trial we've assessed to date, with our assessments and letters. However, where letters have only been sent in the past 4 weeks, we do not include full details below. This is so journals can't use 'prior publication' as a reason not to publish our letters.</p>

        <div id="table">
            <div id="loading">Loading trials...</div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="problem">Why this matters</h2>

        <p>Before carrying out a clinical trial, all outcomes that will be measured (e.g. blood pressure after one year of treatment) must be pre-specified in a trial protocol and on a clinical trial registry (e.g. <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>).</p>

        <p>This is because if researchers measure lots of things, some of those things are likely to give a positive result by random chance (a false positive). A pre-specified outcome is much less likely to give a false-positive result. In the trial report, all pre-specified outcomes must then be reported, to ensure a fair picture of the trial results.</p>

        <p>However, in reality, pre-specified outcomes are often left unreported, while novel outcomes that were not pre-specified are reported. This is an extremely common problem that distorts the evidence we use to make real-world clinical decisions.</p>

        <h2 id="approach">Our approach</h2>

        <p>The <a href="http://cebm.net">CEBM</a> Outcome Monitoring Project (COMPare) takes a new approach. We are monitoring all trials published in the top five medical journals (NEJM, JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ). We are analysing each trial for outcome switching, by comparing the clinical trials registry (or ideally a trial protocol dated before the trial began) against the trial report. For any trial where we find that outcomes have been switched, we are writing letters to the journal to correct the record. All of our results will also be posted here.</p>

        <p>The table above contains a row for every trial. There are links to our letter, and the letter's publication status. We also show a summary of the data: the number of prespecified outcomes correctly reported (for a correctly reported paper this should be 100%); and the number of novel, undeclared, non-prespecified outcomes added in the paper (for a correctly reported paper this should be 0).</p>

        <p>Each row also contains a link to our full assessment sheet for that trial, which is filled out by the two coders who audited that trial, then checked at our weekly project meeting. It lists the pre-specified primary outcomes, whether they were reported, and also lists any new outcomes added. This raw datasheet is shared online to ensure that all our data and working is fully transparent. We are happy to receive <a href="#contact">feedback</a> on any scoring from the trialists concerned.</p>

        <p>Some trials have perfect outcome reporting and no letter is required: these are posted immediately to the table above. Otherwise, we add trials to the table either (i) four weeks after sending our letter, or (ii) when the journal publishes or refuses to publish the letter (whichever comes first). All letters are also posted to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/">PubMedCommons</a>, to try to ensure that the information on outcome switching is available to those using the trial to make decisions about patient care.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <p>Please note that we do not think that prespecified outcomes are set in stone: consistent with the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</a> guidelines, where a prespecified outcome has been switched, but this fact has been discussed or explained in the trial report, we do not regard that as undisclosed outcome switching, and it is not scored as such.</p></div>

        <p> Download <a href="downloads/protocol.pdf">our full protocol</a> (PDF).</p>

        <p>Through increased awareness of misreported outcomes, individual accountability, and feedback for specific journals, we hope to fix the ongoing problem of outcome switching.</p>
