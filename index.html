        <hr />

        <h2 id="problem">The problem</h2>

        <p>Before carrying out a clinical trial, all outcomes that will be measured (e.g. blood pressure after one year of treatment) must be pre-specified in a trial protocol and on a clinical trial registry (e.g. <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a>). This is because if researchers measure lots of things, some of those things are likely to give a positive result by random chance (a false positive). A pre-specified outcome is much less likely to give a false-positive result. In the trial report, all pre-specified outcomes must then be reported, to ensure a fair picture of the trial results.</p>

        <p>However, pre-specified outcomes are often left <em>unreported</em>, while novel outcomes that were not pre-specified <em>are</em> reported. This is an extremely common problem that distorts the evidence we use to make real-world clinical decisions.</p>

        <h2 id="approach">Our approach</h2>

        <p>The COMPare project takes a new approach. We are monitoring all trials published in the top five medical journals (NEJM, JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ). We are analysing each trial for outcome switching, by comparing the clinical trials registry and trial protocol with the trial report. For any trial where we find that outcomes have been switched, we are writing letters to the journal to correct the record. All of our results will also be posted here.</p>

        <p>Through increased awareness of misreported outcomes, individual accountability, and feedback for specific journals, we hope to fix this ongoing problem.</p>

        <p>Download <a href="downloads/protocol.pdf">our protocol</a> (PDF).</p>


        <h2 id="results">Our results</h2>

          <p>The table below gives live data from the project, but for now the specific data for letters submitted but not yet accepted by journals is withheld. This is to avoid journals using prior publication as a reason for not publishing our correction letters on these trials.</p>

          <p>As a result, the table below gives a misleadingly positive impression of the data as it stands, because it shows the data for many trials that were perfectly reported, and hides the data for those where the reporting was extremely poor, but where the journal has not published our letter pointing out the discrepancies.</p>

          <p>In reality, as of <span id='total_trial_count'><em>loading</em></span> trials assessed to date, the current overall mean proportion of prespecified outcomes reported is <span id='mean_prespec_propn'><em>loading</em></span>, and the mean number of non-prespecified outcomes added is <span id='mean_nonprespec_count'><em>loading</em></span>. The total number of prespecified outcomes left unreported to date is <span id='total_prespec_unreported'><em>loading</em></span>. The total number of non-prespecified outcomes reported is <span id='total_nonprespec_reported'><em>loading</em></span>.</p>

        <div id="table">
            <div id="loading">Loading trials...</div>
        </div>

        <p>The table above contains a row for every trial. There are links to our letter, and the letter's publication status. We also show a summary of the data: the number of prespecified outcomes correctly reported (for a correctly reported paper this should be 100%); and the number of novel, undeclared, non-prespecified outcomes added in the paper (for a correctly reported paper this should be 0).</p>

        <p>Each row also contains a link to our full assessment sheet for that trial, which is filled out by the two coders who audited that trial, then checked at our weekly project meeting. It lists the pre-specified primary outcomes, whether they were reported, and also lists any new outcomes added. This raw datasheet is shared online to ensure that all our data and working is fully transparent. We are happy to receive <a href="#contact">feedback</a> on any scoring from the trialists concerned.</p>

        <p>Some trials have perfect outcome reporting and no letter is required: these are posted immediately to the table above. Otherwise, we add trials to the table either (i) four weeks after sending our letter, or (ii) when the journal publishes or refuses to publish the letter (whichever comes first). All letters are also posted to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/">PubMedCommons</a>, to try to ensure that the information on outcome switching is available to those using the trial to make decisions about patient care.</p>

       <p>We're based at the <a href="http://www.cebm.net/">Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine</a>, at the University of Oxford.</p>
